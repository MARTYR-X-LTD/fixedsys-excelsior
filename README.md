# Fixedsys Excelsior

Fixedsys Excelsior is a modification to the original Fixedsys typeface, which was the default font of **Microsoft Notepad** in Windows 95, 98 and Me.

These is not an exclusive martyr⁠— creation, but rather a continuation of the work of many different authors.

#### Background

The initial typeface was developed by Microsoft for earlier versions of Windows. The original fonts used a vastly different format, incompatible with modern systems. Extensive work had to be done to convert them into usable standards like OTF and TTF.

The conversion procress has been done by several different people. Main source of Fixedsys Excelsior was this [Github repo](https://github.com/kika/fixedsys).

Nonetheless, a few fixes were needed to work correctly under Photoshop and other design applications. The main ones: rendering was not pixel perfect, and hinting needed to be disabled.

And that's martyr⁠— contribution :)

The release is free and credits to all the contributors behind the work been done for each font. Naming some: Microsoft, [Darien Valentine](https://github.com/bathos), [Kirill Pertsev](https://github.com/kika), and **martyr⁠—**
